/*
When it comes to gizmo display and interaction there's a set of
almost orthogonal questions that must be answered for every selection set.

Apparently, this topic is a little convoluted and there's no one-size-fits-all
solution, that would work "intuitively" from the UX perspective.

Also, nonuniform scaling is a complete torture, as we normally don't have
a way of representing "skew" in the Transform type, so what would be
intuitive from the perspective of linear algebra is not accessble to us.

Here's the options that are available followed by the ones I want to settle on:


1. Where the gizmo is located:
    a. At midpoint of all selected; (Blender)
    b. At some "last selected";

2. How the gizmo is oriented in local mode:
    a. Forbidden to operate on multiple selections in local mode;
    b. As some "last selected"; (Blender)
    c. As an average orientation of all selected (what is that even?);


[1a, 2b] - This is what Blender does, and it seems to work fine there.
This, however, requires that we always keep track of some "last selected",
and all algorithms that do selection have to comply in an intuitive manner.

"Last selected" is also useful for quick parenting, so I like the idea still.


3. How to apply the resulting transformation to the nodes:
    a. Equally to each Transform of each selected;
    b. To the lowest depth selected node(s) of each subtree only; (Blender)


[3b] - Option "a" is not really an option. If you translate both the parent
and the child by the same dx, the child ends up translated by 2*dx, which
is not the most intuitive, or useful, outcome.

Option "b" is reasonable, but will force us to walk the tree up all the time,
and is more cumbersome to implement, but should at least make sense.


4. How to treat rotation of multiple selections:
    a. Around local pivots of each selected; (Blender 1)
    b. Around midpoint of all selected;      (Blender 2)
    c. Around some "last selected" pivot;    (Blender 3)
    d. Around some special pivot object;     (Blender 4, this is the 3D Cursor)


[4b] - Now, here all options make sense in some context, and blender implements
them all successfully, but I'd like to keep my setup relatively small.
Option "b" here seems to me like the most useful one by default, so we'll stick with it.


5. How to treat nonuniform local scaling of multiple selections:
    a. Forbid nonuniform scaling of multiple selections;
    b. Scale locally for each selected;
    c. Reproject scaling coefficient back to local axes of each object; (Blender)

6. How to treat nonuniform world scaling:
    a. Forbid nonuniform world scaling entirely;
    c. Reproject scaling coefficient back to local axes of each object; (Blender)


[5a, 6a] - While Blender has a "solution" for this problem, nonuniform scaling is literal
hell and the Blender solution is not something that is super predictable or intuitive.

We disable nonuniform scaling along world axes, and any nonuniform scaling for multiple
selections. Essentially, every time the scaling axes are not the local basis
of the object, we don't allow that scaling.

EDIT: This is not true for now, as *all* non-uniform scaling is forbidden. For sanity.


7. How to treat *uniform* scaling of multiple selections:
    a. Forbid scaling of multiple selections;
    b. Scale locally for each selected;
    c. Scale around a midpoint, convert to scale + translation; (Blender)


[7c] - Uniform scaling is less problematic, although scaling multiple selections
has the additional challenge that relative distance between points has to be preserved.
This will require translation of all objects w.r.t. the midpoint. Should be doable.


(There may be more options for each point)

                        1. Position of each pivot has to be rotated around the midpoint.
                        2. Orientation of each object has to be rotated around the local axis.

                    When only one object is selected, the midpoint is equal to pivot,
                    so no translation takes place.

                    Similar to rotation, scaling around a midpoint is a combination of
                    a translation and local scaling.

                    Except that due to how we use the gizmo, the matrix does not represent
                    uniform scaling at all. Instead it only scales Y axis in gizmo space.

                    So we need to get the matrix in gizmo space, make it uniform,
                    and then transform that to other spaces.
